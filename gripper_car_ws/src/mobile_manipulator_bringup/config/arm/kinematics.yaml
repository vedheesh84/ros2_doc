# KINEMATICS CONFIGURATION - Mobile Manipulator
# ==============================================
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Inverse kinematics solver configuration for MoveIt
#   Defines how to solve IK for each planning group
#
# SOLVER:
#   kdl_kinematics_plugin - KDL (Kinematics and Dynamics Library)
#   Fast analytical solver for 6-DOF arms
#
# USAGE:
#   Loaded by move_group for motion planning
#

# ARM GROUP - Main manipulator
arm:
  kinematics_solver: kdl_kinematics_plugin/KDLKinematicsPlugin
  kinematics_solver_search_resolution: 0.005  # Resolution for IK search (meters/radians)
  kinematics_solver_timeout: 0.05              # Timeout for IK solver (seconds)
  kinematics_solver_attempts: 3                # Number of attempts to solve IK
